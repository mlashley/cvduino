Visual Inspect / Probe-testing
1. Ground, 5v at IC pins, 10v6 etc. etc.
2. IO header pins -> ICs.

AVR
(Todo fuses for external crystal?)
1. ICSP Chip Ident with avrdude.
2. ICSP Chip Blink PD7 LED.
3. ICSP Simple serial print/echo and use USB-TTL attached to H1 T10/12
4. MIDI Note-On/Off = LED blink.

Power
1. Apply 12v power and check 5v
2. Apply 12v power and check/adjust 10.6v

10v6 switching/PWM
1. Apply simple on-off to PB0..3 and check it follows at CV1..4 @ 10v6(ish)
2. Apply 25,50,75% duty cycle PWM and measure outputs.
